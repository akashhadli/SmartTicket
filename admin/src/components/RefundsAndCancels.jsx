						Ticket/Pass once purchased by Commuter/Passenger will not be
						cancelled when the request is successful by the application.
						However, subject to the user/commuter/passenger reasoning, LekPay
						reserves the right to deny any refund to user/commuter/passenger
						pursuant to a cancellation initiated by the user. If tickets/pass is
						not successful and the user/commuter/passenger provides sufficient
						proof, the money may be refunded within 10 days, as may be necessary
						at the sole discretion of LeyPay.

					<p>
						1. Tickets/pass once booked is non-refundable and non-transferrable
						<br />
						2. User/commuter/passenger should use the mobile app to register and
						make purchases from the LekPay app
						<br />
						3. In case of any fraud detected, LekPay reserves the right to block
						the user from further using the app and no money will be refunded.

						We do not charge any platform fees on our App purchase, the charges
						paid by the users will be completely transferred to the Transport
						operator account.
